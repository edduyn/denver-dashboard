```csv
week_ending,denver_position,denver_ab_actual,network_avg
2026-02-15,19,38.8,52.3
```

### Example 2: New Feature Request
**You:** "Ralph, add a section showing top 5 employees by billable hours this month"

**Ralph:**
```
❓ Quick questions:
1. Should this be on the Overview tab or Employees tab?
2. Display as a table or leaderboard?
3. Include both hours and percentage?

[You respond: "Employees tab, leaderboard style, show both"]

✅ Planning implementation...
✅ Designing leaderboard component
✅ Writing SQL query for top 5 employees
✅ Creating HTML/CSS for leaderboard display
✅ Adding to loadEmployeeData() function
✅ Testing with current data... Looks good!
✅ Committing: "Add top 5 employees leaderboard"
✅ Pushing to GitHub... Deployed!
✅ Check it out: https://edduyn.github.io/denver-dashboard/ (Employees tab)
```

### Example 3: Goal Update
**You:** "Ralph, Goal #4 isn't tracking correctly. It should measure actual flat-rate hours variance from expected"

**Ralph:**
```
✅ Analyzing Goal #4 current state...
✅ Current: Static "Analysis" badge
✅ Needed: Dynamic tracking with variance calculation

❓ Data source questions:
1. Where do I get expected hours? (squawk_data.json or new table?)
2. Where do I get actual hours? (employee_time table?)
3. By shop (SDN/SDV/SDR/SHC) or overall?

[You respond: "squawk_data.json has expected, employee_time has actual, show by shop"]

✅ Creating query to join squawk_data + employee_time
✅ Adding variance calculation logic
✅ Updating Goal #4 card with progress bar
✅ Adding shop breakdown display
✅ Implementing monthly timeline tracking
✅ Testing calculations... Variance: -12% (under expected)
✅ Deploying...
✅ Done! Goal #4 now shows real-time flat-rate tracking
```
