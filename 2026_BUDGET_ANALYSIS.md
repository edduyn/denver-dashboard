## 💡 PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT TIPS

### 1. Labor Revenue Optimization ($2.4M Budget)

**Current Gap:** 19.7pp below A/B target

**Actionable Strategies:**

#### A. Increase Billable Hours
- **Reduce shop time**: Target 90% of available hours as billable
- **Minimize rework**: First-time-right quality reduces non-billable corrections
- **Pre-planning**: Have parts ready before job starts (reduces waiting time)
- **Cross-training**: Fill gaps with multi-skilled technicians

#### B. Track Non-Billable Categories
Create dashboard tracking for:
- Training hours (necessary but non-billable)
- Waiting for parts (can be minimized with better planning)
- Rework/warranty (indicates quality issues)
- Shop maintenance (schedule during slower periods)
- **Target**: <10% of total hours should be non-billable overhead

#### C. Monthly Labor Revenue Target
- **$202,471/month** average
- February target: ~$190,728 (from budget)
- Track daily: $202,471 / 21 working days = **$9,642/day**

**This is your profit engine!**

- **Protect pricing**: Don't discount labor rates
- **Efficiency**: Complete jobs in estimated time
- **Upselling**: Identify additional work during inspections

#### B. Parts Margin (25.0%)
- **Vendor negotiations**: 1% margin improvement = $35,000/year
